# Ethereum Gas Fees Explained

Ethereum transactions require **gas fees** to compensate validators for processing and securing the network. Since the London hard fork (EIP-1559 in August 2021), the fee system has become more predictable. Below are the key concepts: **Gwei**, **Gas Limit**, **Base Fee**, **Priority Fee**, and how they combine to determine the total cost (often referred to as "gas price" or total gas fee).

## Key Concepts

### Gas
- **Gas** is a unit that measures the computational effort required to execute operations (e.g., sending ETH, interacting with smart contracts).
- Simple transactions (e.g., ETH transfer) use ~21,000 gas.
- Complex operations (e.g., DeFi swaps or NFT mints) use much more.




### Gas Limit
- The **Gas Limit** is the maximum amount of gas you're willing to spend on a transaction.
- You set this when sending a transaction (wallets often auto-suggest it).
- If the transaction uses less gas than the limit, the unused portion is refunded.
- If it exceeds the limit, the transaction fails ("out of gas"), but you still pay for the gas used.

### Gwei
- **Gwei** (Gigawei) is the common unit for measuring gas prices.
- 1 Gwei = 0.000000001 ETH (10⁻⁹ ETH).
- Fees are quoted in Gwei for readability (e.g., 20 Gwei instead of 0.00000002 ETH).




### Base Fee
- Introduced by **EIP-1559**.
- A mandatory fee per unit of gas, calculated and adjusted automatically by the protocol for every block.
- Depends on network congestion: higher demand → higher base fee (and vice versa).
- The **base fee is burned** (removed from circulation forever)—it does **not** go to validators.

### Priority Fee (Tip)
- An optional **tip** you add to incentivize validators to include your transaction quickly.
- Also called **Max Priority Fee per Gas**.
- In low congestion, a small tip (e.g., 1-2 Gwei) is enough; in high congestion, higher tips help prioritize your tx.

### Max Fee per Gas
- The absolute maximum you're willing to pay per unit of gas (Base Fee + Priority Fee).
- You set this when submitting the transaction.
- Protects you from sudden base fee spikes.

## How Fees Are Calculated (EIP-1559)

**Formula**:

1. **Effective Gas Price** = Base Fee + Effective Priority Fee  
   (Effective Priority Fee = the lesser of your Max Priority Fee or (Max Fee - Current Base Fee))

2. **Total Fee Paid** = Effective Gas Price × Gas Used

- The **Base Fee × Gas Used** is burned.
- The **Priority Fee × Gas Used** goes to the validator as a tip.
- Any difference between what you offered (Max Fee × Gas Limit) and what was actually used is refunded.

**Example** (simplified):
- Current Base Fee: 30 Gwei
- You set Max Priority Fee: 2 Gwei
- You set Max Fee: 50 Gwei
- Gas Used: 21,000 (simple transfer)

→ Effective Price = 30 + 2 = 32 Gwei  
→ Total Fee = 32 Gwei × 21,000 = 0.000672 ETH  
→ Base Fee portion (30 Gwei part) burned  
→ Tip (2 Gwei part) to validator

## Legacy vs. EIP-1559 Transactions
- Older ("legacy") transactions use a single **Gas Price** field.
- Modern wallets use EIP-1559 by default for better predictability and automatic refunds.

## Viewing on Etherscan
On Etherscan transaction pages, you'll see:
- **Gas Used**
- **Base Fee**
- **Priority Fee**
- **Burned amount**
- Current network Base Fee and suggested tips on the homepage.

This system makes fees more predictable while burning ETH (reducing supply) and rewarding validators fairly.
