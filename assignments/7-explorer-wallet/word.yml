At this stage, it is **just text**.

### 4. Mnemonic → Seed (SHA-256)

The mnemonic phrase is hashed using **SHA-256**.

This produces:
- A 256-bit value
- Represented as 64 hexadecimal characters

This hash is treated as the **seed**.

---

### 5. Seed → Private Key (Keccak-256)

The seed is hashed again using **Keccak-256**.

The output is another 256-bit value.

This value is used as the **Ethereum private key**.

⚠️ Anyone with this key controls the wallet.

---

### 6. Private Key → Public Key (secp256k1)

The private key is passed into the **secp256k1 elliptic curve**.

This produces an **uncompressed public key**.

- Starts with `0x04`
- Contains X and Y coordinates

---

### 7. Public Key → Hash

- The `0x04` prefix is removed
- The remaining bytes are hashed with **Keccak-256**

This produces a 32-byte hash.

---

### 8. Ethereum Address

- The **last 20 bytes** of the hash are taken
- Converted to hexadecimal
- `0x` is prepended

This final value is the **Ethereum address**.

---

## Final Wallet Output

- Mnemonic phrase  
- Seed (SHA-256)  
- Private key (Keccak-256)  
- Public key (secp256k1)  
- Ethereum address  

Each step depends entirely on the previous one.

## Important Warning

This wallet logic is **for learning only**.

It does NOT fully follow:
- BIP-39
- BIP-32
- BIP-44

Do **not** use this to store real funds.

## How Real Wallets Improve This

Real wallets like MetaMask add extra layers:

### BIP-39 Mnemonic Standard
- Fixed 2048-word list
- Embedded checksum
- Detects typing mistakes

### PBKDF2 (2048 Rounds)
- Uses HMAC-SHA512
- Slows down brute force attacks
- Optional passphrase support

### Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets
- One mnemonic → unlimited addresses
- Defined in BIP-32 / BIP-44

Why This Project Matters

This project removes the magic.

It shows that wallets are not mysterious —
they are built from simple cryptographic steps.

If you understand this flow, you understand Ethereum wallets.
