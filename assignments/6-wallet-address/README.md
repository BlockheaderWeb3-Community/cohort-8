# Quantum-computer Wallet Alogrithm and Improvement Analysis
Blockchain wallets are fundamental tools for managing digital assets. Their security relies heavily on cryptographic primitives such as hash functions and public-key cryptography. Current wallet systems, including those used by major blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, are designed under the assumption that adversaries use classical computers.

However, the emergence of quantum computing introduces new attack models that significantly weaken or completely break many classical cryptographic systems. Algorithms such as Shor’s algorithm and Grover’s algorithm fundamentally change the security assumptions behind elliptic-curve cryptography and hash functions.
## Wallet Generation Algorithm
### Mnemonic Code Word Generation

The random entropy generated by the CSPRNG is converted into a set of mnemonic code words. These words serve two purposes:

They allow human-readable backup and recovery

They preserve the underlying entropy in a structured form

### Concatenation of Mnemonic Words

All mnemonic words are concatenated into a single string. This creates a deterministic input for hashing while ensuring that the entire mnemonic contributes to the final seed.
HA Hashing of the Mnemonic

The concatenated mnemonic string is hashed using the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA). This step compresses the input into a fixed-length output and ensures diffusion, meaning small changes in the input produce large, unpredictable changes in the output.

###  Seed Consolidation

The output of the SHA hash is treated as the cryptographic seed. At this stage, all previous steps are combined into a single value that represents the wallet’s core secret material.

### Keccak-256 Hashing

The seed is hashed again using Keccak-256. Keccak is the hash function used by Ethereum and is designed to be resistant to known cryptanalytic attacks. This second hashing step further randomizes the seed and reduces structural patterns.

### Private Key Generation

The output of the Keccak-256 hash is interpreted as a 256-bit private key. This private key is the most sensitive component of the wallet, as possession of it grants full control over the associated funds.

### Public Key Derivation Using secp256k1

Using elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) on the secp256k1 curve, the private key is transformed into a public key. This operation is computationally easy in one direction but extremely difficult to reverse using classical computers.
### Public Key Hashing

The public key is hashed using Keccak-256. This step hides the raw public key and adds an additional layer of protection against certain attacks.

### Address Generation

The final wallet address is produced by taking the last 20 bytes of the Keccak-256 hash of the public key and prefixing it with 0x. This address is what users share publicly to receive funds.

# Role of BIP-32 Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets

BIP-32 allows multiple private keys to be deterministically derived from a single master seed. This design enables:

Easy backup and recovery using one seed

Generation of many addresses without storing each private key

Structured wallet organization using derivation paths

Despite these benefits, BIP-32 relies on elliptic-curve cryptography and therefore inherits its quantum vulnerabilities.


# Quantum Threat Model and Vulnerability Analysis

### Grover’s Algorithm and Hash Functions

Grover’s algorithm provides a quadratic speedup for brute-force search. This effectively halves the security of hash functions. For example:

SHA-256 provides ~128-bit security against a quantum attacker

Keccak-256 provides ~128-bit security against a quantum attacker

While these levels are still secure today, they are insufficient for long-term, future-proof systems.

### Shor’s Algorithm and Elliptic-Curve Cryptography

Shor’s algorithm can efficiently solve the elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem. This means that any system relying on secp256k1 becomes completely insecure once a sufficiently powerful quantum computer exists. An attacker could derive the private key directly from the public key.

### Public Key Exposure Risk

In many blockchain systems, public keys are revealed during transaction signing. This creates a direct attack surface for quantum adversaries.
